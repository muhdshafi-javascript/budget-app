## Modules Pattern
In JavaScript, code encapsulation can be achieved using Modules Patterns. In addition, it is used to create private and public properties. 
**here are some of the benefits:**
- Freeze the scoping.
- Code encapsulation.
- Creating private or public scope.
- Creating a namespace.
- Creating public and private encapsulation.
**Implementation in ES5**
- Using Object literals and IIFE, the closure feature in javascript make it possible to encapsulate the private data/method.
